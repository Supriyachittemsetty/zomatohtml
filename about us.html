        Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. 
        The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010
        as they were unsure if they would  "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with April 2015,
        Zomato acquired the American online table reservation platform NexTable, which was subsequently renamed Zomato Book.
        In January 2016, it launched Zomato Book's table reservation feature on its application in India. In April 2015,
        it acquired cloud-based point of sale (PoS) company MapleGraph Solutions, and, in April 2016, launched its own version of PoS
        for restaurant owners called Zomato Base, comprising menu and inventory management, payment system, and analytics. Later that year,
        Zomato acquired Sparse Labs (renamed Zomato Trace) and integrated the latter's real-time delivery location tracking technology on its
         food delivery platform.
